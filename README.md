## tamagothchi-mini-project

### Reason for making the game
This was Project Zero for Unit 1 of my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program

#### Here were the requirements
- Create a repo
- Create a Tamagotchi Class
- Instatiate the Tomagotchi
- Give the user the ability to name the pet
- Stylize the page
- Display a character sprite of your choice on the screen
- Animate the pet across the screen while it's alive
- Display the following metrics: Hunger (1-10), Sleepiness (1-10), Boredom (1-10), Age
- Add buttons to feed the pet, turn off the lights (sleep), and to play
- Increase the pet's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom stats at the interval of your choosing
- Have the pet's age go up, and morph at certain ages
- The pet should die if hunger, sleepiness or boredom hits 10

#### Here is additional functionality included along with the above
- Restart button
- Function to disable buttons after pet dies to make sure the stats decrease if pushed after pet's death
- A message comes up telling the user the reason the pet died

##### Here is a list of the functionality I wanted to add, but didn't get around to before the class presentation
- Add an animated bone when the Let's Play button is pushed
- Add sound effects to the buttons
- Include an exercise function that affected all of the stats at one time
